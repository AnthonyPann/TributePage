<h2 class="tribute-text">Rachel Carson, biologist and author of <i>"Silent Spring"</i>, was a leader in the environmental movement in the 1960s. She challenged the idea of human dominance over nature. <i>"Silent Spring"</i> warned of the dangers of pesticide overruse and its impacts on local insect and bird populations. </br>
</br>
Carson developed a lifelong love for nature growing up in rural Pennsylvania, eventually becoming a marine biologist. She studied biology and zoology before working for the US Bureau of Fisheries. Much of her work involved writing articles and other media for public education. Some notable works include <i>"The Sea Around Us"</i> (1952), <i>"Under the Sea-Wind"</i> (1941), and <i>"Silent Spring"</i> (1962).</br>
</br>

Carson faced relentless opposition from chemical and pesticide companies. Through all the attacks and sexism she faced as a female scientist, she maintained her dedication to scientific education.


<p class="indent"><i>There is symbolic as well as actual beauty in the migration of the birds, the ebb and flow of the tides, the folded bud ready for the
spring. There is something infinitely healing
in the repeated refrains of nature -- the
assurance that dawn comes after night, and
spring after the winter.</i></br>
</br>
-Rachel Carson, <i>"The Sense of Wonder"<i></p>
